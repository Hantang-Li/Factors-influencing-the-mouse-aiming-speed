Factors influencing the mouse aiming speed

A STA305: Design and Analysis of Experiments course project.

Recently we just experienced course selection on the Quercus, and all of us were required to react and move
our mouse as fast as possible to grab our favourite bird course. I failed to select my ideal bird course and
started to examine any possibilities to improve the selection speed. Although the internet condition is hard
to change at home, we can improve the mouse aiming speed. I researched that first-person shooting game
players sometimes switch their mouse pad to soft or hard or change their mouseâ€™s dpi (dots per inch, a
measurement of mouse sensitivity) setting to improve their aiming accuracy. Note that shooting games are
very similar to select a course; we all need to move our mouse to targets quickly and click on it. Further, I
found that some mice can swap the right-click button and left-click button, and I wonder whether that will
affect the aiming speed.
